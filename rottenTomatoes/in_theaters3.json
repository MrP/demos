Upon returning to a privileged city life in newly independent 1960s Nigeria after their expensive English education, the two women make very different choices. Olanna shocks her family by going to live with her lover, the \"revolutionary professor\" Odenigbo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and his devoted houseboy Ugwu (John Boyega) in the dusty university town of Nsukka; Kainene turns out to be a fiercely successful businesswoman when she takes over the family interests, and surprises even herself when she falls in love with Richard (Joseph Mawle), an English writer. Preoccupied by their romantic entanglements, and a betrayal between the sisters, the events of their life seem to loom larger than politics. However, they become caught up in the events of the Nigerian civil war, in which the lgbo people fought an impassioned struggle to establish Biafra as an independent republic, ending in chilling violence which shocked the entire world.

Mickey finds himself stuck in a life-and-death struggle compounded by a body he can't bury, a wife he can't please, and a debt he can't pay.

In the great American tradition of people venturing into the woods and encountering absolutely pants-wetting terror, what starts as two dorks with a video camera having a lark in a national park metastasizes into something much deeper, darker, and queasier. Set in Humboldt County, California, Willow Creek centers on Jim (Bryce Johnson, Pretty Little Liars) a Bigfoot believer whose idea of a romantic getaway is to head deep into Six Rivers National Forest in Northern California, video camera in tow, trying to shoot his own Bigfoot footage at the site of the Patterson-Gimlin film. That 1967 fragment of footage purporting to show Sasquatch striding along a dry riverbed became a key artifact in the cryptozoology community, and Jim dreams of nothing more than setting foot on the actual location where it was shot. His long-suffering girlfriend, Kelly (Alexie Gilmore, World's Greatest Dad), agrees to tag along for the ride, despite the fact that she thinks Bigfoot has about as much chance of being real as leprechauns.

The hotel still bears the traces of its impressive past. As a young medical student travelling from Moscow en route to Paris, young Nicolai (Leonid Bichevin) meets and falls in love with the beautiful courtesan Elise (Sylvia Hoeks) at the hotel, which is also a brothel. Nicolai prolongs his stay, despite Elise's friend Nina's (Renata Litvinova - PASSIONS) discouragement. After a few days, it becomes obvious that their love is doomed, and he is forced to depart: Elise \"belongs\" to the old Count (Dieter Hallervorden - DIE DIDI SHOW), who also owns the hotel. Five years later upon Nicolai's return to the hotel on his was back to Moscow, the Count takes violent measures. Elise makes a choice for the young Nicolai and the Count stops his payments to her. Her debts mean Elise, who has also fallen ill, cannot leave the hotel with Nicolai. Elise asks Nicolai to leave alone, but he refuses. She then pretends to reverse her choice, and returns to the Count. Enraged, Nicolai leaves for Moscow. Some years later, a now wealthy Nicolai returns to the hotel to take revenge on his rival. Nicolai snubs Elise and returns for good to Moscow. Elise, desperately alone and ill, remains in the empty hotel, which is closed down following the Count's death. 50 years later, old Nicolai receives a visit at his office in Moscow from old Nina (Svetlana Svetlichnaya - THE DIAMOND ARM). She brings him a book of Pushkin poems containing a handwritten message for Nicolai from Elise. Nicolai decides to return to the hotel forever to relive the tragedy that embodies the end of an era and the vibrant hopes and life of both its young couple and of a new world.

IDOW is written and directed by Robert Fantinatto with Jason Amm (Ghostly International recording artist Solvent) serving as producer and co-writer. Inventors, musicians and enthusiasts are interviewed about their relationship with the modular synthesizer - for many, it's an all-consuming passion. Established musicians such as Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Carl Craig and John Foxx show off their systems and explain why they opt to use this volatile but ultimately rewarding technology. Meanwhile, a new generation of dance and electronica artists including Clark, James Holden and Factory Floor explain why they've stepped away from laptops to embrace the sound and physicality of modular synthesizers. Innovative companies like Modcan and Doepfer, driven by a desire to revive modular synthesizers, discuss how they planted the seeds that have now grown into a major cottage industry. What started out as a \"vintage-revival scene\" in the '90s has grown into an underground phenomena with a growing market of modular obsessives craving ever more wild and innovative sounds and interfaces. Today, the modular synthesizer is no longer an esoteric curiosity or even a mere music instrument - it is an essential tool for radical new sounds and a bonafide subculture.(c) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/89/11178920_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/89/11178920_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/89/11178920_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/17/89/11178920_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"3636334"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771380575.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_dream_of_wires/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771380575/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771380575/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771380575/similar.json"}},{"id":"771363517","title":"Test","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":89,"release_dates":{"theater":"2014-06-06"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Fresh","critics_score":88,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":64},"synopsis":"Set in the free-spirited San Francisco of 1985, Test lovingly portrays this exciting and harrowing era as young Frankie (dancer Scott Marlowe in a breakout acting debut) confronts the challenges of being an understudy in a modern dance company where he's taunted to \"dance like a man!\" Frankie embarks on a budding relationship with hunky Todd (Matthew Risch, HBO's \"Looking\"), a veteran dancer in the same company and the bad boy to Frankie's naivete.

His sister, a conscientious student, is stumbling through an unconsummated love affair with an older guy, Beto (Juan Eduardo Palacios), who is treated like dirt in brutal police cadet training sessions in the desert. One foolish decision on the too-green sister's part - allowing Beto to hide some drugs in a water tank on the roof of their home - sends the lives of her entire family into a tailspin.

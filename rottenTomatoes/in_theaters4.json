For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he.

He and his partner Aash (Aasif Mandvi) will have to close their business down for good if JB doesn't come up with something fast. Late one night, while watching cricket being played in India on TV, JB comes up with an idea so radical it just might work. Why not go to there and find the next baseball pitching sensation? Setting off for Mumbai with nothing but a gifted but cantankerous scout (Alan Arkin) in tow, JB stages a televised, nationwide competition called \"Million Dollar Arm\" where 40,000 hopefuls compete before two 18-year-old finalists, Rinku and Dinesh (Suraj Sharma, Madhur Mittal), emerge as winners. JB brings them back to the United States to train with legendary pitching coach Tom House (Bill Paxton). The goal: get the boys signed to a major league team. Not only is the game itself difficult to master, but life in the U.S. with a committed bachelor makes things even more complicated-for all of them. While Rinku and Dinesh learn the finer points of baseball and American culture, they in turn teach JB the true meaning of teamwork and commitment. Ultimately, what began as a purely commercial venture becomes something more and leads JB to find the one thing he was never looking for at all-a family.

On stage, Donna is unapologetically herself, joking about topics as intimate as her sex life and as crude as her day-old underwear. But when Donna gets dumped, loses her job, and finds herself pregnant just in time for Valentine's Day, she has to navigate the murky waters of independent adulthood for the first time. As she grapples with an uncertain financial future, an unwanted pregnancy, and a surprising new suitor, Donna begins to discover that the most terrifying thing about adulthood isn't facing it all on her own. It's allowing herself to accept the support and love of others. And be truly vulnerable. Never failing to find the comedy and humanity in each awkward situation she encounters, Donna finds out along the way what it means to be as brave in life as she is on stage. Anchored by a breakout performance from Jenny Slate, OBVIOUS CHILD is a winning discovery, packed tight with raw, energetic comedy and moments of poignant human honesty.

Naive, innocent Anna soon finds herself in the presence of her aunt Wanda (Agata Kulesza), a worldly and cynical Communist Party insider, who shocks her with the declaration that her real name is Ida and her Jewish parents were murdered during the Nazi occupation. This revelation triggers a heart-wrenching journey into the countryside, to the family house and into the secrets of the repressed past, evoking the haunting legacy of the Holocaust and the realities of postwar Communism. In this beautifully directed film, Pawlikowski returns to his native Poland for the first time in his career to confront some of the more contentious issues in the history of his birthplace. Powerfully written and eloquently shot, IDA is a masterly evocation of a time, a dilemma, and a defining historical moment; IDA is also personal, intimate, and human. The weight of history is everywhere, but the scale falls within the scope of a young woman learning about the secrets of her own past. This intersection of the personal with momentous historic events makes for what is surely one of the most powerful and affecting films of the year.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/73/11177362_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Agata Kulesza","id":"770988935","characters":["Wanda Gruz"]},{"name":"Agata Trzebuchowska","id":"771463956","characters":["Ida/Anna"]},{"name":"Joanna Kulig","id":"770706904","characters":["Singer"]},{"name":"Dawid Ogrodnik","id":"771420673","characters":["Lis"]},{"name":"Jerzy Trela","id":"770697153","characters":["Szymon"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2718492"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ida_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771362047/similar.json"}},{"id":"771373910","title":"Moms' Night Out","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"PG","runtime":98,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2014-05-09"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":17,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":87},"synopsis":"All Allyson and her friends want is a peaceful, grown-up evening of dinner and conversation... a long-needed moms' night out.

Star chef Alexandre Lagarde (Jean Reno) is in danger of losing his reputation, along with his beloved restaurant. Fate brings the two together and helps them along a journey through the intoxicating world of French haute-cuisine. A legend in his own time, Lagarde is in serious conflict with Stanislas Matter (Julien Boisselier), the new CEO of the group that owns his restaurant, Cargo Lagarde. Matter is plotting to destroy Lagarde's reputation so that he'll have grounds to fire Lagarde and move the restaurant away from Lagarde's classic French cuisine towards trendy molecular gastronomy. Desperate to cling to his status as a Three Star chef (a rarity in the world of fine dining), Lagarde teams up with Jacky and together they try to find the balance between tradition and trend, as well as between family life and food obsession.

John Greystoke, Jr. was just a toddler when he accompanied his adventurous mother and father on a journey into Africa in search of a mineral that could revolutionize the energy industry. That trip turns tragic, however, when their helicopter crashes in a race to escape a massive storm, leaving young John the sole survivor. Raised from that day forward by a motherly gorilla named Kala, the boy, now named Tarzan, quickly integrates into the family of primates. But alpha male Silverback Tablat refuses to accept Tarzan's presence, viewing him as a direct threat to the clan. Nearly a decade later, Tarzan encounters beautiful Jane Porter, and begins to long for human contact. When Jane returns to the jungle accompanied by smooth-talking entrepreneur William Clayton a few years later, her relationship with Tarzan is rekindled. But while Clayton has ostensibly come to the jungle to support Jane's conservationist endeavors, he's actually searching for the very same energy source once sought by Tarzan's father, and hopes to turn a tidy profit by exploiting the precious resource. The situation turns critical when Jane recognizes Clayton's true intentions, and the only one who can save her from both the villainous industrialist and the menacing Tablat is the noble Tarzan of the apes. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/51/11175135_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/51/11175135_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/51/11175135_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/51/11175135_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Kellan Lutz","id":"770685152","characters":["Tarzan"]}],"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771318427.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tarzan_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771318427/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771318427/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771318427/similar.json"}},{"id":"771324984","title":"Citizen Koch","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"Unrated","runtime":110,"release_dates":{"theater":"2014-06-06"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":53,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":53},"synopsis":"Last year, public television officials pulled $150,000 in funds they had committed to the documentary and cancelled plans for the film's broadcast premiere, as reported by Jane Mayer in The New Yorker, in fear of losing the financial backing of major PBS donor David Koch, the ultra-conservative billionaire industrialist and WGBH and WNET trustee.

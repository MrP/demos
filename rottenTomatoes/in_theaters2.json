Pixieish, mohawk-sporting Klara (Mira Grosin) and her best friend Bobo (Mira Barkhammar) are 13-year-old rebels looking for a cause. Despite having no instruments-or discernible musical talent-the two put all their energy into forming an all-girl punk band, recruiting their shy, classical guitar-playing schoolmate Hedvig (Liv LeMoyne) as the third wheel. With tender affection for his young characters and the period in which his film is set, Moodysson paints an ebullient and sharply observant portrait of DIY spirit and growing up different.

It was a battle that ended with the taking of his own life at the age of 26. Aaron's story touched a nerve with people far beyond the online communities in which he was a celebrity. This film is a personal story about what we lose when we are tone deaf about technology and its relationship to our civil liberties.

Through interviews profiled at Arizona State, Cooper Union, and Sebastian Thrun's Udacity-among several others-IVORY TOWER reveals how colleges in the United States, long regarded as leaders in higher education, came to embrace a business model that often promotes expansion over quality learning. Along the way we also find unique programs, from Stanford to the free desert school Deep Springs to the historically black all women's college Spelman, where the potential for life-changing college experiences endure.

Harmon is a former Marine, radicalized by tours of duty overseas. His life in the military is behind him, but at heart he remains the same reckless alpha male he always was, eager for adventure, excited by the prospect of mayhem and destruction. Dena is a high society dropout, sickened by the consumer economy into which she was born. She's moved west and cut ties with her family, edging ever deeper into radical politics. And Josh, their leader, is a self-made militant, devoted to the protection of the Earth by any means necessary. A son of the middle class who works on an organic farm, he's an intensely private person by nature and may have the deepest convictions of them all.

Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended \"audition\" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.

Then on one fateful day, through a series of absurdly amusing encounters, everything changes: his girlfriend rebuffs him, his father cuts off his allowance, and a strange psychiatrist dubiously confirms his 'emotional imbalance'. Meanwhile, a former classmate insists she bears no hard feelings toward him for his grade-school taunts when she was \"Roly Poly Julia,\" but it becomes increasingly apparent that she has unfinished business with him. Unable to ignore the consequences of his passivity any longer, Niko finally concludes that he has to engage with life.

Anchored by intimate one-on-one interviews with the man himself, Nicholas Wrathall's new documentary is a fascinating and wholly entertaining portrait of the last lion of the age of American liberalism. Commentary by those who knew him best-including filmmaker/nephew Burr Steers and the late Christopher Hitchens-blends with footage from Vidal's legendary on-air career to remind us why he will forever stand as one of the most brilliant and fearless critics of our time. Gore Vidal's professional life spans more than 50 years of American politics and letters. His return to America in 2005 marked the last great stage in his creative career and this film represents an extraordinary opportunity to share his view on America in the twenty-first century. Featuring candid verite footage of Vidal in his final years, the film explores his enduring global impact on art, politics, and everything in between. His overview of the current state of the Republic and the health of US democracy is unique and incisive. This is Gore Vidal's last word and testimony.

Set against the backdrop of WWII, The Last Sentence is based on the life of crusading journalist Torgny Segerstedt, editor-in-chief of one of Sweden's leading newspapers, highlighting his one-man battle against Nazism and his country's policy of appeasement to Hitler. With Sweden caught between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Russia, the country's elites chose a policy of neutrality and compliance, with few daring to speak up against the evil around them. Among those who did, nobody was as loud and as uncompromising as Segerstedt (Danish star Jesper Christensen, Nymphomaniac: Volume 1, Melancholia), one of the most prominent Swedish journalists of the 20th century. In the eyes of many of his countrymen, his pen was far more dangerous than the Nazi sword. Amidst the political turmoil of the era, Segerstedt's own personal life took a dramatic and scandalous turn as he entered into a very public affair with Maja Forssman, the Jewish wife of his close friend, the newspaper's publisher. Maja Forssman is played by Pernilla August, winner of the Cannes Best Actress Award for Bille August's Best Intentions.

While investigating noises in his house one balmy Texas night in 1989, Richard Dane puts a bullet in the brain of a low-life burglar, Freddy Russell. Although he's hailed as a small-town hero, Dane soon finds himself fearing for his family's safety when Freddy's ex-con father, Ben, rolls into town; hell-bent on revenge. However, not all is as it seems. Shortly after Dane kills the home intruder, his life begins to unravel into a dark underworld of corruption and violence. Twists and turns continue to pile up as the film reaches its inevitable destination: a gore-soaked dead end. Michael C. Hall brings a shell-shocked vulnerability to his portrayal of Dane that contrasts perfectly with the grizzled \"badasses\" portrayed by Sam Shepard and Don Johnson. Directed with an excellent eye for the visual poetry of noir, this pulpy, southern-fried mystery is a throwback to an older breed of action films; one where every punch and shotgun blast opens up both physical and spiritual wounds.

They are armed and deadly. Their quarry is Camiel Borgman, living in military sparseness in an underground den, near companions Ludwig and Pascal. Camiel scrapes out with some difficulty, hitching a ride with a doomed truck driver on a relentless trip to the heart of suburbia. He passes by two odd women, Brenda and Ilonka, with whom he seems to share a history. When a dirty Camiel arrives at the door of artist Marina and media executive Richard's expansive, designer-chic home, the shifting perceptions of Van Warmerdam's screenplay begin to displace and disorient the audience. Hallucinogenic elements dot the consciousness as Camiel shifts between the roles of victim and aggressor. He asks for a bath. He toys with Richard's jealousy. He is viciously beaten up by his cruelly intolerant host and left wounded on the floor. Marina seeks to assuage her guilt by allowing him a space for the night. She treats his wounds. She makes him some food. She begins to deceive her husband. And Camiel Borgman insistently starts to install himself in the house as his dark advances ebb and flow, push and pull. Marina is self-obsessed; Richard a casual racist; they employ a nanny Magot to look after their three small children, the youngest of whom, Isolde, sees Camiel early on and is responsive to his presence. \"There is something that surrounds us,\" says Marina, fearfully, but she is no longer in control. Large dogs roam casually through the house. There are flashes of something sinister in the garden as Camiel waits, and watches. Soon he is inhabiting Marina's dreams. \"Couldn't you come back in another capacity?,\" she asks him. \"I could,\" he says, \"...but it will have consequences.\" (c) Drafthouse","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177894_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177894_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177894_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/78/11177894_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jan Bijvoet","id":"771425985","characters":["Borgman"]},{"name":"Hadewych Minis","id":"770694331","characters":["Marina"]},{"name":"Jeroen Perceval","id":"771063562","characters":["Richard"]},{"name":"Sara Hjort Ditlevsen","id":"770871379","characters":["Stine"]},{"name":"Eva van de Wijdeven","id":"770780242","characters":["Ilonka"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1954315"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771355862.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borgman/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771355862/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771355862/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771355862/similar.json"}},{"id":"771376202","title":"The M Word","year":2014,"mpaa_rating":"R","runtime":111,"release_dates":{"theater":"2014-05-02"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":38,"audience_rating":"Spilled","audience_score":20},"synopsis":"As he did in \"EATING,\" \"GOING SHOPPING,\" \"BABYFEVER\" and \"IRENE IN TIME,\" Writer-Director Henry Jaglom gives us a bracingly funny, fearless and fast-paced human comedy about yet another vital issue facing all women at a certain critical turning point in their lives. Set in a struggling Los Angeles television station threatened by economic downturn, possible in-house graft and massive job loss, Tanna Frederick plays Moxie, a children's TV show actress who unexpectedly turns into a Joan of Ark (with the passion of Norma Rae) when she finds herself leading an extraordinary band of rebelling women demanding their rights as they anxiously face uncertain futures after their new boss (Michael Imperioli) and his second-in-command (Robert Hallak) arrive from New York on a devastating cost-cutting mission. All of Moxie's personal and professional assumptions and those of her long-time boyfriend (Corey Feldman) are turned upside-down as her mother (Frances Fisher), her two aunts (Mary Crosby and Eliza Roberts), and her stepfather (Gregory Harrison), join with dozens of her fellow female office workers to illuminate the struggles, challenges and joys of what is still, in some circles, referred to as 'The Change Of Life.'

But this precarious partnership is put to the test when the brothers meet Pinky (Niharika Singh), an exquisite ingenue with a shady past.

Unfortunately the same cannot be said for their retirement nest egg which is wiped out when Richard's investment firm is defrauded and the pension fund is siphoned away. Learning that the unscrupulous French financier behind the scheme has just purchased a $10million diamond for his bride to be, the divorced duo grudgingly agree to set aside their differences, and hatch a plot to gate-crash the wedding and steal the rock.

During Saint Laurent's breathtaking and groundbreaking show, he met with another fate in being introduced to Pierre Berge (Guillaume Gallienne), patron of the arts, future love of his life and lifelong business partner. Three years later, the two founded the Yves Saint Laurent Company, which would rapidly become one of the biggest luxury powerhouses on the planet.
